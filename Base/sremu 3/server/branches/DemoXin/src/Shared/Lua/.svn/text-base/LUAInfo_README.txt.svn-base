Hey guys.

The lua code you see here is, of course, not original code by the SREmu team :>

I feel it necessary to give a HUGE thanks to the guys responsible for Lua, PUC-RIO.

Of course, their project website is at: http://www.lua.org/.  It has lots of great resources
for you guys who want to learn lua as well as the documentation for the lua library used
here in SREmu :).



The version currently used by SREmu is Lua 5.1.4.  If you integrate a new version with no problems,
hit us up with any changes you had to make, so we can get that updated ASAP!

As requested on their website, I will give you a textual copy of their license below and a link
to their license page:
