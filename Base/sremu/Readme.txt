Sourceforge SVN Repository for SREmu

Founders:
Daniel "clearscreen"
Justin "jMerliN"
Brian "darkmind"
Yidam "telatoro"

Current developers:
Justin "jMerliN" Summerlin

Thanks to:
Drew "pushedx"
"Cryorus"
"Klevre" (I add him with reluctance, as he's a massive douchebag)

Project dependencies:
- libmysql 5.1 (Should be lib/include folder from MySQL install zip, 32bit, at C:\deps\mysql5.1)
- lua 5.1 (should be pre-compiled lib/include folder, 32bit, at C:\deps\lua5.1)

Without these, building WILL FAIL.  I do not provide documentation on how to produce or obtain these binaries, not yet anyway.

Development blog coming soon.  Stick around.


SREmu2 is meant as a development emulator.  As such, I will not be optimizing anything.  I will not spend time making efficient or 
well-planned-out objects.  I will create basic primitives and abuse them.  The goal is to make it "work" and anything beyond that is 
outside the scope of this project.  Therefore, hosting this as your "private server" is highly ill advised.  You would need to put the 
work into refactoring it into a workable server daemon.  I also will NOT be supporting it in *ANY* way outside of the files I provide 
here.

**** DISCLAIMER *****
AGAIN.  DO NOT USE THIS AS AN OFFICIAL "PRIVATE SERVER".  THE CODE IS CERTAINLY INSECURE.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
THIS PROJECT IS MERELY A SANDBOX.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE KNOWN, UNDISCLOSED BUGS WHICH CAN EASILY CRASH YOUR SERVER OR EVEN
ALLOW REMOTE CODE INJECTION.  HOST THIS IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

FURTHER, IF IN HOSTING THESE FILES YOU ARE CONTACTED IN ANY MEANS BY JOYMAX IN REGARDS TO A LAWSUIT, AS THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED
BY THE LICENSE, YOU CANNOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE.  THIS PROJECT IS NOT INHERENTLY ILLEGAL BUT MISUSE MAY BE.
*********************

And yes, that means if you find a bug, I don't care.  It's a feature.  Enjoy.


Thanks,

Justin
